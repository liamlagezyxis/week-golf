 * - The function retrieves the name or ID of the user to get the relation with, as well as the authentication token.

 * - If the token is invalid or not found, the function sends a 404 error.
 * - The function queries the database to get the ID of the requested user based on the provided name or ID.
 * - If the requested user is not found, the function sends a 404 error.
 * - The function checks if the requested user is the same as the user who made the request, and returns a status of -1 if true.
 * - The function checks if the user who made the request follows the requested user, and sets the first bit of the status accordingly.
 * - The function checks if the requested user follows the user who made the request, and sets the second bit of the status accordingly.
 * - The function sends a JSON response containing the status of the relation between the two users.
