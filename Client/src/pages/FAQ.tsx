                        However, you can write a comment under someone's post to congratulate them on their response or ask them for a part of their code that you may not have understood.<br/>
                        You can also join the <a href="https://github.com/aderepas/WeekGolf">WeekGolf discord server</a> to interact with the members there and much more!<br/>

                    answer: <span>
                        You can do it using <code>prompt()</code><br/>
                        And even if it is marked "JavaScript" so that a maximum of people understand it, it's rather Node.JS.<br/>
                        Because it is not really possible to take STDIN in pure JavaScript.<br/>

                        You can't.<br/>
                        But if you think that one logo is missing, don't hesitate to less us know by contacting an admin by discord or at <a href="mailto:admin@week.golf">admin@week.golf</a><br/>
